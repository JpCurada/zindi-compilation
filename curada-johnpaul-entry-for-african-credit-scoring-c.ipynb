Background\n\nThe African financial landscape is undergoing significant transformation with the rise of digital lending platforms and increased financial inclusion initiatives. However, assessing creditworthiness remains a complex challenge due to several unique factors:\n\nTraditional credit scoring methods often fall short in the African context because:\n1. Many potential borrowers lack conventional credit histories\n2. Economic conditions vary dramatically across different regions\n3. Market dynamics can shift rapidly, affecting borrowers' repayment capabilities\n4. Limited access to formal banking systems creates gaps in financial data\n\nA private asset manager operating across African financial markets has presented this challenge to develop more sophisticated approaches to credit risk assessment. The goal is to leverage machine learning to analyze both traditional loan data and macroeconomic indicators, creating a more comprehensive risk evaluation system.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## II. Objectives\n\nThe challenge has three primary objectives:\n\n1. **Model Development**\n   - Create a machine learning model that accurately predicts loan default probabilities\n   - Develop a solution that can generalize across different African markets\n   - Achieve high performance as measured by the F1 Score metric\n   - Balance model complexity with interpretability\n\n2. **Credit Scoring System**\n   - Design a scalable credit scoring function for the top 10 winners\n   - Transform model probabilities into actionable risk categories\n   - Create a system that can adapt to different market conditions\n   - Ensure the scoring system is transparent and implementable\n\n3. **Risk Assessment Framework**\n   - Incorporate both individual loan characteristics and economic indicators\n   - Identify key factors that contribute to default risk\n   - Create a framework that can support rapid decision-making\n   - Enable expansion into new markets while managing risk effectively\n\nSuccess in this challenge will contribute to more efficient lending practices across African markets, potentially increasing access to credit while maintaining sustainable risk levels for financial institutions.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## III. About Datasets\n\nThe analysis utilizes three primary datasets that provide comprehensive information about loan transactions, customer details, and economic indicators:\n\n1. **Train.csv/Test.csv**  \nThese files contain the core loan and customer information, consisting of 16 variables. The dataset includes unique identifiers, loan details (amount, type, duration), customer information, and lender-specific data. The target variable indicates whether a customer defaulted (1) or paid (0) their loan. This data forms the foundation for building our predictive model.\n\n| Variable Name | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| ID | A unique identifier for each entry in the dataset. |\n| customer_id | Unique identifier for each customer in the dataset. |\n| country_id | Identifier or code representing the country where the customer resides or where the loan was issued. |\n| tbl_loan_id | Unique identifier for each loan associated with the customer. |\n| Total_Amount | The total loan amount initially disbursed to the customer. |\n| Total_Amount_to_Repay | The total amount the customer is expected to repay, including principal, interest, and fees. |\n| loan_type | The category or type of loan. |\n| disbursement_date | The date when the loan amount was disbursed to the customer. |\n| duration | The length of the loan term, typically expressed in days |\n| lender_id | Unique identifier for the lender or institution that issued the loan. |\n| New_versus_Repeat | Indicates whether the loan is the customer's first loan (\"New\") or if the customer has taken loans before (\"Repeat\"). |\n| Amount_Funded_By_Lender | The portion of the loan funded directly by the lender. |\n| Lender_portion_Funded | Percentage of the total loan amount funded by the lender. |\n| due_date | The date by which the loan repayment is due. |\n| Lender_portion_to_be_repaid | The portion of the outstanding loan that needs to be repaid to the lender. |\n| target | This variables takes the value 0 or 1. 1 means the customer defaulted on the loan, whereas 0 means, the customer paid the loan. |\n\n2. **economic_indicators.csv**  \nThis dataset provides crucial macroeconomic context through nine key economic indicators for different countries. It includes:\n\n| Variable Name | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG | Inflation, consumer prices (annual %) |\n| PA.NUS.FCRF | Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |\n| FR.INR.RINR | Real interest rate (%) |\n| AG.LND.PRCP.MM | Average precipitation in depth (mm per year) |\n| FR.INR.DPST | Deposit interest rate (%) |\n| FP.INR.LEND | Lending interest rate (%) |\n| FR.INR.LNDP | Interest rate spread (lending rate minus deposit rate, %) |\n| EG.USE.COMM.FO.ZS | Fossil fuel energy consumption (% of total) |\n| SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS | Unemployment rate |\n\nThese indicators can significantly influence a borrower's ability to repay loans, as they reflect the overall economic health of the country where the loan was issued.\n\nThe combination of individual loan data and macroeconomic indicators allows for a more comprehensive analysis of loan default risk, taking into account both personal financial circumstances and broader economic conditions that might affect loan repayment behavior.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Install
